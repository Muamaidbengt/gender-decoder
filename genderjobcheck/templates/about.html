		<h2>About this tool</h2>
		<p>Both the job advert and reference letter checks on this site are based on published papers by professional researchers. This site uses the same word-lists as the original research to make its assessments.</p>
		<h3 id="job-ads">Gender bias in job adverts</h3>
		<p>This site was originally inspired by a research paper written by Danielle Gaucher, Justin Friesen, and Aaron C. Kay back in 2011, called <a href="https://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~ack23/Publications%20PDFs/gendered%20wording%20JPSP.pdf">Evidence That Gendered Wording in Job Advertisements Exists and Sustains Gender Inequality</a> (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, July 2011, Vol 101(1), p109-28). The job advert checking on this site follows the process used in this research.</p> 
		<p>In this paper the researchers showed job adverts which included different kinds of gender-coded language to men and women and recorded how appealing the jobs seemed and how much the participants felt that they 'belonged' in that occupation.</p>
		<p>Their results showed that women felt that job adverts with masculine-coded language were less appealing and that they belonged less in those occupations. For men, feminine-coded adverts were only slightly less appealing and there was no effect on how much the men felt they belonged in those roles.</p>
		<p>You can see the <a href="/job-adverts/word-lists">full lists of words that this research considered masculine- and feminine-coded</a>. This tool checks job adverts for the appearance of any of these words, then calculates the relative proportion of masculine-coded and feminine-coded words to reach an overall verdict on the gender-coding of the advert. Some words have been reduced to a 'stem' to cover a range of noun, verb and adjective variants; for instance "compet" covers "compete", "competetive" and "competition".</p>
		<p>I don't totally agree with all the entries in these wordlists. I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts on what's in the lists and shouldn't be, or what's not included that should be. Let me know via Twitter <a href="http://www.twitter.com/lovedaybrooke">@LovedayBrooke</a>, or a <a href="https://github.com/lovedaybrooke/gender-decoder">pull request</a>.</p>

		<h3 id="ref-letters">Gender bias in reference letters</h3>
		<p>The reference letter analysis done on this site is inspired by two papers:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2572075/">A Linguistic Comparison of Letters of Recommendation for Male and Female Chemistry and Biochemistry Job Applicants</a> by Toni Schmader, Jessica Whitehead, and Vicki H. Wysocki (Sex Roles. 2007; Vol 57(7-8), p509–514).</li>
		<li>
		<a href="http://advance.uci.edu/images/Color%20of%20Glass.pdf">Exploring the color of glass: letters of recommendation for female and male medical faculty</a> by Frances Trix and Carolyn Psenka (Discourse and Society. 2003; Vol 14, p191–220).
		</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The analysis in these papers is a little more involved. The authors take a sample of real reference letters that accompanied applications to the Chemistry and Biochemistry faculties (in the first study), or Medical faculty (in the second study) at two different American universities. The first study found that these letters were more likely to describe men as outstanding in some way, than women. This trend persisted even when the researchers compared equally qualified men and women, with equal publishing histories.</p>
		<p>The second study found that reference letters for women were more likely to describe them as hardworking or diligent, than letters for similarly qualified men. However, the first study found no significant evidence of this correlation between gender and 'grindstone' adjectives. It did find that applicants described as outstanding were more likely to be described with 'ability' adjectives than 'grindstone' adjectives.</p>
		<p>To reach these results, the researchers checked the reference letters against 3 different wordlists: 'standout' words, 'grindstone' words, and 'ability' words. (They actually tested a few other hypotheses with further wordlists but, as the results for these were negative, they aren't included in this site's analysis. <a href="/ref-letters/word-lists">See the reference letter wordlists</a></p>
		<p>Unlike the job advert research, this study didn't examine the impact of this language on those involved in hiring. However, the bias towards referring to men as outstanding probably has a significant effect on their relative attractiveness to universities, compared to equally qualified women.</p>
